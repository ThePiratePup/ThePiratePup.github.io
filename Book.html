					<p>
						When I talk to friends, family, and strangers about my research, they often describe academic work as impenetrable—filled with technical jargon and overwhelming detail.
						Yet, my conversations outside of an academic audience are some of the most fruitful in exploring these ideas (and often the foundation of my research methodology).
						To make sense of this, I often think of researchers as the ents from Tolkein's Lord of the Rings.
						As Treebeard says, "it takes a long time to say anything in old entish, and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say."
						Research papers are like having a conversation in the "old entish" language.
						Over the course of years, we bounce ideas back and forth between academics in a way that takes a very long time to explore important ideas.
						But, as Treebeard realizes when he decides to fight back against Isengard, this is not always the most productive way to have a conversation.<br />
					</p>
					<p>
						The conversations and ideas explored in academia are important to explore outside of academic contexts, as well.
						Non-academic spaces tend to move at a faster pace and engage in the same ideas from different angles.
						In an effort to explore important topics with a broader coalition, I host a book club.
						If you are interested in participating, please contact me for more information!
						We discuss the topics in my research, projects, and teaching, as well as requests or recommendations from participants.
						I would love to hear what you are interested in discussing, and find a way to include you in the conversation.

						Why Fish Don't Exist by Lulu Miller
					</p>
					<p>
						Lulu Miller has loved a man, loved a woman, and hates the term "bisexual".
						Delving into her personal existential crisis of category, Miller turns to the lifelong work of David Starr Jordan—murderer, progenator of American eugenicism, and founding president of Stanford University.
						Miller looks to Jordan in an effort to grapple with a depressive response to optimistic nihilism:
						she explains how, at a young age, her father told her there is no purpose to life, but that means you can choose to cherish every moment and be kind to others.
						But... what if that first bit (about nothing mattering) is too much to handle?
						How do you force yourself to overcome that and live so fully that you can defy that deep feeling that you don't belong?
						These are the questions at the heart of Miller's crisis. <br />
					</p>
					<p>
						Miller's interest in fish-taxonomist David Starr Jordan begins because, despite his life's work burning in a fire and (separately) shattering in an earthquake,
						despite his friends and family perishing at sea or to sickness,
						and despite political pressures that threaten his way of being, he carries on.
						Miller asks... How? HOW?
						Miller's hunger to answer this question ripples through every page of this book, and turns to bitterness as she learns about each of Jordan's horrific actions.
						Ultimately she finds solace in a few ways, one being that Jordan's work of classifying fish was meaningless.<br />
					</p>
					<p>
						Why Fish Don't Exist is a celebration of fluidity—a story of self-acceptance and finding how to live in a world filled with chaos.
						The questions of category explored in this book mirror those that have informed my work in genre studies (particularly, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3723498.3723721">the Roguelike or PTD videogame genre</a>) and offer a solid introduction to discussion of topics that center definitional boundaries.
						Living in the United States, I see similar questions of category come up constantly.
						Not just the low-stakes of "What is a Roguelike?", but also:
						Who gets to make decisions about their own body?
						Who gets to be comfortable going to the bathroom?
						Who gets to have health insurance?
						Who gets to vote?
						I have found Miller's book a useful point of reference to highlight the significant impact of how we decide to create categories
						and to connect important topics to some of my work.
