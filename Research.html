				<p>
					I broadly summarize my research interests into three paths:
					embedded morality,
					media as communication,
					and media literacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Embedded Morality</strong></br>
					I use the term "Embedded Morality" to highlight the misleading endeavor of assumed neutrality.
					More often than tools, technology, or actions portray neutrality, these things portray and embody moral choices on the behalf of their creators.
					Langdon Winner offers a useful example in his discussion of political artifacts. Winner discusses the infamous urban planner Robert Moses's design of the overpass system in New York City.
					There, he designed the bridges to be too low for buses to pass underneath.
					This way, anyone in the city who traveled primarily by bus (notably and intentionally, poorer members of the community and often POC) would have a much more difficult time accessing parks and other public spaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a form of embedded morality: an artifact imbued with the moral decisions (in this case, anti-social and racist decisions) of its creator.
					But artifacts are not the only thing that can be imbued in this way.
					Experiences are often designed and delivered in much the same way as objects (e.g. see Ian Bogost's <a href="https://bogost.com/books/persuasive_games/">Persuasive Games</a>).
					I theorize this sort of embedded morality within experiences as <strong>procedural ethics</strong>.
					Some of my published work discusses this in the context of AI literacy, developing the term <strong>creative ethos</strong> to describe the ways in which artists navigate the moral decisions intertwined with the use of tools like generative AI.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I continue developing these ideas and engaging with this area of work, I also consider:
					How can we intentionally embed specific (learning) experiences into games (e.g. serious games)?
					How can we analyze the embedded morality of an object by looking to its affordances?
					How can we understand the influence a tool or technology will have on its user?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Media as Communication</strong></br>
					For my research, "Media as Communication" describes the nuance of how media (and language surrounding media) is used to convey meaning.

					For example, using queer theory to inform analysis of Roguelike definitions.

					PTD, farming sim stuff going on

					often described through the lens of evolutionary biology, but art and ideas are not limited by the same rules of lineage.
					a "species of art" (a genre) can never go extinct, and inspiration for a work can be taken from any combination of genres.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Media Literacy</strong></br>
					"Media Literacy" is a broad umbrella that includes my work conducting ethnographic studies gathering artists' response and engagement with emerging media (right now, primarily generative AI).

					How we understand how we underastand media

					Overall, my research is a critical investigation of emerging computational media. Especially
					important to this investigation are the creative and ethical inquiries that arise as new tech-
					nologies and tools develop. Artists’ responses and resistance to the expanding prominence
					of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) is a particular focus of my research. This work
					brings attention to creative priorities in traditionally computational spaces, operating at the
					intersection of human-computer interaction, digital humanities, and digital arts.
				</p>

				<p>
					My dissertation argues that generative artificial intelligence systems are complex data ecosys-
					tems inhabited by stakeholders with conflicting interests, where ethical and technical consid-
					erations are integrally intertwined. This framing contrasts dominant narratives which portray
					genAI systems as all-purpose productivity-enhancement tools. The resistance displayed by
					artists is central in this intervention, providing perspectives that illuminate workflow frictions
					and motivational dissonance between genAI developers and the users of these systems. Using
					ethnographic interviews, I spoke with artists across disciplines to gather their insights from
					using and resisting generative technologies in creative practice. These interviews produce data
					especially attentive to friction between creative priorities and computational implementations.
					For example, research participants often question the power dynamics at play in the develop-
					ment of generative tools. The dissertation uses thematic analysis to formulate understanding
					from interview responses and construct models of AI literacy. The first chapter examines
					resistance to generative systems in creative domains, highlighting an interactive photo-mosaic
					constructed from the contributions of a community of artists who shared stories of their
					generative experiences. The second chapter considers the influence of corporate pressures on
					the adoption of generative workflows, examining low-stakes hobbyist environments alongside
					professional spaces. This chapters presents a framework for critical AI literacy constructed
					from creative priorities, centering creative acts and ethical decisions as a lens to consider
					generative media. The third chapter discusses use-cases where generative practices mirror
					historical artistic workflows (such as music sampling), highlighting opportunities for generative
					technologies to empower artists with tools that align with their definition of effective and
					ethical workflow integration.
				</p>

				<p>
					This research provides understanding of generative AI in underexplored creative spaces
					through the construction of critical AI literacy, empirical data, and theorizing genAI as its own
					medium. Such work provides 1) models for navigating ethical tensions in creative inquiries,
					2) lenses for comparing creative and ethical priorities across disciplines, and 3) guidance
					for further development of generative tools. Further, this work situates emerging media in
					historical conditions of power and highlights the voices of artists who have expressed particular
					vulnerability to generative technologies.
				</p>

				<p>
					Three publications, in particular, provide foundational work for this dissertation. Published
					in the proceedings of the 2024 CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,
					Is resistance futile?: Early Career Game Developers, Generative AI, and Ethical Skepticism
					investigates a cohort of game development interns grappling with generative workflows
					alongside their first professional exposure. Accepted into CHI PLAY 2025, How Do You
					Want to View This? Generative AI, Creative Ethos, and TTRPG Hobbyists examines the
					low-stakes environment of tabletop roleplaying game hobbyists, highlighting creative navi-
					gation of ethical inquiries relating to genAI outside of a professional context. Currently an
					in-progress manuscript for the ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference, the third study
					investigates music creators who use generative AI to investigate generative workflows that
					strongly resemble non-generative historical practice. Also relevant to the dissertation, and
					presented in the 2024 AIIDE Workshop on Experimental AI in Games, Axes of Characterizing
					Generative Systems: A Taxonomy of Approaches to Expressive Range Analysis acknowledges
					the challenge of describing bias present in generative outputs, and explores the application of
					analysis methods from the domain of procedural content generation.
				</p>

				<p>
					My next research project is developing a theory of media that centers experience. Media
					studies often theorize media as material, e.g. Marshall McLuhan’s ”the medium is the
					message” or Langdon Winner’s ”political artifacts.” An experience-based theory of media
					responds to the increasingly interactive nature of emerging media (e.g. generative AI and
					”gamification”) and provides a lens to better understand experiential design across media
					contexts. A key contribution to this project is my work developing the term ”procedural
					ethics.” In my presentation of Ethics of Non-choice: An Exploration of Procedural Ethics in
					Twelve Minutes and Griftlands at the Digital Games Research Association’s 2023 Morality
					Play workshop, I discussed how gameplay embodies and encourages certain types of moral
					experiences—ethical values are embedded into the designed experience of games. Extending
					this work, I am currently developing a manuscript for a special issue of the journal Well-Played
					titled Experiential and Experienced Ethics in Gameplay: A Play-Centric Interpretation of
					Twelve Minutes and Griftlands. This piece further explores how games can evoke morally
					significant experiences through elements such as gameplay loops.
				</p>

				<p>
					Overall, this research agenda develops critical models of understanding media, prioritizing
					creative and ethical inquiries. Such work provides context-specific knowledge for domains of
					artistic practice such as game development, tabletop roleplaying games, music production,
					and digital art production where such investigations are underexplored and community
					members have expressed particular vulnerability to emerging technologies such as generative
					AI. Further, this work enables effective comparison across domains, both between art forms
					and across computational and creative contexts. Ultimately, this agenda formulates methods
					of communicating about media attentive to interdisciplinary priorities.
