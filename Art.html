						<strong>AI Resistance Photo-Mosaic</strong></br>
						I'm currently cultivating an AI resistance interactive photo-mosaic.
						Pieced together from hundreds of images from a broad and growing community of artists of a variety of disciplines, this mosaic offers contributors an opportunity to share their critical thoughts about generative AI.
						Viewers of the mosaic can select a specific image from the mosaic to view a statement from the image's artist.</br>
						I've heard from technical artists who work as game developers who found their work in training datasets for generative models without providing consent,
						multimedia artists who fear the artwork found on Magic: The Gathering cards will no longer be human-created,
						film industry graphic designers who recall uncomfortable conversations as everyone on crew realized some posters on a film set were AI-generated,
						and many, many more!
					</p>
					<p>
						If you'd like to contribute to this project, please <a href="contact.html">send me an email with the subject line: <strong>Photo-Mosaic Submission</strong>!</a>
						Include <strong>your name, an image, and (optionally) an artist's statement (up to 200 words)</strong> highlighting your experience of AI resistance.
						I'm looking for artists of any discipline and any skill level to share their stories and offer a piece of art to add to the interactive mosaic.

						<strong>Automattack!</strong></br>
						Automattack is an electro-mechanical, player-vs-player board game about moving electricity through tiny automatons on a chess-like board. 
						This game emphasizes tactile play elements while demonstrating the laws of electricity through naturally enforced game mechanics.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>SOLARCADE</strong></br>
						SOLARCADE is a pop-up solar-powered arcade cabinet. This community-promoting station for play houses tiny games from a coalition of indie game developers in local spots where the sun shines, 
						offering passersby an opportunity for outdoor, shaded play experiences while promoting the work of indie developers.
